This is a sample to test https://qainterview.pythonanywhere.com/

Using Testcafe, I focused on just testing the factorial function that was implemented.

I created 4 tests:
  1. Testing with a small simple integer (3). 
      Expected output contains: 6
  2. Testing with a large integer (989)
      Expected output contains: Infinity
  3. Testing with a text input (text)
      Expected output: Please enter an integer
  4. Testing with a decimal value (0.2)
      Expected output: Please enter an integer.
